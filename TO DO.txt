TO DO
-----------------
- plots
- factories
- quests
- brewing, not really required but id like to overhaul it, also this will pave the way for enchants, maybe make a copy of the old system incase i need to revert. brewing would be a stat, you need a witch hat in your armor slot, and a cauldron in your accessory slot. potion effects will be seperate from the old effects (which will now be called abilities) since they are scalable, also maybe some specific potion related accessories, like witches hat could buff your potions by 25%, and cauldron could debuff enemy potions by 25%. cauldron could also just have lots of defense since its made of a lot of iron (and a mana crystal, meaning the recipe only needs 1). the witches hat is a rare drop from witches. there would be upgrades but ill think abt those later, like maybe various runes which would replace cauldrons and give a bit better brewing stats, and also have a unique power. like a fire rune would damage your opponents with fire as like an additional effect (this and the wither effect would work opposite to how you might expect, in that you having the effect will damage your enemy). theres some other cool item possibilities, maybe an accessory that blocks effects from both sides. now the cool part, i think ill have a seperate bag from the main bag, maybe called the pouch, which can store items with data. the main ones being potions. this pouch would be capped at 15 items. you can sell these items to players with a special command called pouchoffer, which just works like offer but for this, the reason being is because you have to do special work since you can have multiple of a single item type and there would be no way to differentiate that for normal items, so in pouchoffer you give the pouch slot not the item name. i think potions could just become a singular item now. when you brew a potion it will have a random strength for I to III, maybe there will be certain recipes to have multiple effects, but besides that you are stuck with one effect. this is based a lot on your brewing strength, so high brewing means you will get better strengths on average. for multi effect potions it gets harder, idk exactly how but for normal the base is I, and you roll between 0 and 2 to increase it more, with multi it'd b like I,I (or however many it is) and you roll between 0 and 2, 1 increases by 1, 2 increases by 1 and rolls again, by increase by 1 i mean it takes the lowest or the first if tied and increases. if you want to trash an item you can use /pouchsalvage, and that will give you a fixed cost for the item types, which is 50% market value if it has one, or a preset value for potions and anything else i think of (which is based on what their market value should be), or if i am missing anything then it defaults to 0 and gives a message saying to ask me since i forgot, and i will have to manually give them the money and set it. each brew gives you some experience, this is based on the total strength of what you brewed, so like II,I gets you 3 experience (meaning even if you don't need multi effect potions they will get you the most experiene). this works similarly to combat xp, and maybe it will be renamed that, and im not exactly sure how you will end up using it, but uh yeah. maybe certain mobs will drop like a fire rune template for instance, and you use xp to turn it into a normal fire rune. and there are tiers that require different levels of xp. maybe each rune also limits you to a certain list of potions you can craft. runes are immediate use for combat and for brewing.
- enchantments, works similarly to brewing, but its a different system, needing wizard hats, and such. also just like potions its a one and done thing, so you cant double enchant your sword, you have to pick one enchant. all gear from enchants and brewing would be banned at first, and placed in my list of things to add, and added once i have an opening, since they can have cool effects like some i described above. ill do this after both though, since if i do brewing ill do enchantments, and there will be more items so yeah. scrolls instead of runes, and enchant xp not brewing xp. scroll restricts you to set enchants, maybe even directly. scrolls are used similarly.
- elections, just preparing for them with some variables so i can easily apply some easy buffs. like lowered bcc for fishing, boosted doc for mining, boosts rarer enemies (just adds like 50 power to mob power), increased item chances (just adds like 25 power to fishing mining and fighting), sell percent (default is 10%), increased plot daily limit by 20%, 20% faster factories
- achievements, these would be all the typical mob trophy items, but also the panzer, rocket, masterbolt, and other special items, as well as maybe the pumpkin farm, and some other notable things.
- personal statistics, lets you see stuff like mobs killed, and all that stuff, general page then specific pages, have more statistics like for mining and fishing, pretty much each category in help would have a page for this
- update/rewrite help, also split into two things, /help is for all commands, /guide is for important commands and for the text posts at the top (the current help). and maybe put together some posts for the forum
- although there is the forum and help, i think a wiki is gonna go a long way, i was hesistant before but with all the locations with all the items you can get in each one, and all the mobs, it is going to be really tedious to use the bot to find the information, so i will make a wiki on fandom. and for when im doing the wiki remember zoglins are mini bosses, the wither is the only boss so far. also should clarify that a lot of stuff is not canon, for example fighting the wither is not part of the canon, nor is most item rewards like zombies dropping bars, and you mining netherite bars or titanium bars, though simpler items like finding fish and zombies are obviously canon. so ill clarify what is and isnt canon. also i can add estimated prices for all items, and these would be based on a basic value. like the comet fragments would be based on the 5% chance, and only using an old rod and the bait. this would be inclusive so includes the crafting items. this could also be done for those that are like crafted but also on market to give them a more accurate value. then id also have a paragraph explaining how i got this figure in case other people want to modify it or just know its true. also a page with achievements would be helpful, things for people to aim for besides money, and also a bit of an explanation on how to get them. 
- gangs is probably the last thing i will work on, i will probably make an annoucnement before just to get everyone ready and so people can start playing with the bot to get familiar, just to get it active, and also work a lot on the wiki. for gangs there will be join and leave, all the gang leaderboards, prioritise gang stalls, set stalls to gang only, etc, and for the shop 5% of the 10% that you don't receive goes to your gang, that doesn't make any difference, for stalls it will be smaller at only 1% since profit margins are tighter. also i need to ask whether nether star should be a godlike combat accessory, doing something like x1.5 every stat (which is really good but not undoubtedly the best so its still more fun, unlike netherite weapons which have to be powerful), or a drop accessory maybe like banning common drops or something strong. also remember to add the gang stats for duels.
- i also wanna start preparing my gang, not sure if worm gang is the best name, i will keep thinking, but i wanna make the server, hopefully recruit soup ill dm him, and just yeah prepare for launch. i wanna have it fairly organised with each member having like an item they r responsible for, and they would spend their daily mining/fishing/fighting on that, and put it in a stall for the rest of us. preferably not many fishing since this is a fishing gang if we can't fish freely whats the point. any one can donate gang money but only the leader (which i will just write their id in the file along the description name and emoji, no need for commands i cant be bothered, also letting ppl freely change might be a bad idea) can withdraw, but doing so displays a huge message. i will be very transparent with what i spend the money on, and it will be things for all of us, like kits, etc.
- after im done all the 1.0 stuff, i think i should make a github so people can see the code (.gitignore for data [although still provide default files only removing user data pmuch], todo, and .env), maybe i can put some of the detailed explanations there too, as well as big changelogs, also github would let me see how many lines it is and i am wondering that, and would make it easier for ppl to help me, also curious the python to json percentage because there are a lot of lines of json but also a lot of code, maybe like 75-25 but idk i imagine its quite a lot. also invite caramel back when i release it. maybe make a youtube video about it, though clarify they need to credit if they want to use it, and advertise blue server.

- looking forward to doing a poll about ranking the hardest minibosses/bosses/pseudominibosses (probably just title it enemies but thats what i mean), not sure what format i would do to rank them idk if google forms does that, i do want the ranking, maybe some voting website has ranked choice voting and is expandable to that many. well i will include the wither just for the lolz but i imagine everyone would agree its the hardest. i would also say for any minibosses you haven't fought just guess based on its stats. ill mention results on the miniboss/boss page, like elder guardian i imagine is very easy, so i will say despite having the highest base stat total of any miniboss that isn't a pseudoboss it is found the 2nd easiest, also in the table of all the mobs ill have one of the fields be ranking on this poll, and have the source be a link to the discord server, and probably a collection of screenshots. perhaps it would work better just as a discussion, and then votes in discord for quick 1v1s.

- i wanna do a tournament between mobs, like a round of 32 elimination thing (idk how many mobs there are but id like to do all of them but i might exclude a few to get to the nice number, otherwise ill have to randomly give some mobs a free pass to the second round). should be fairly easy to make a command to watch two mobs fight. random brackets, and random pairings within the brackets (since first goes first in a speed tie and thats a slight advantage). i guess i would do the 3rd and 4th place match too, but no others (if i include this placement too it would just be like top 8 or whatever for the highest round they reached). cool addition to the wiki, and probably will have a page in history even though its not technically to do with the history.

- future update ideas:
	battles - cap of 50 so requires everyone to help, panzers still count as one each even tho u kill multiple
	crates - automatic fishing item, wood iron gold and lava, lava is like a gold+ for only lava, these give some good items and a lot of ores, a lot of the weirder fishing drops would be moved into crates except biome specifics, and this will leave more room for cooler fishing related items, maybe even a jungle crate since there quite a few jungle items, this would be good for items like potions so you can get enough of them from a crate that its worth it to use potions
	kraken - a special boss battle that you are able to summon using the suspicious eye. by special i mean unique, it will have its own command, and wont be something ill make more of, since well i want it to be special but also its specifically coded. it wont be like the other bosses, its stats will be in the function, and will have special attacks. also maybe a bit of lore, like it will say you embark on your boat, and the kraken might try to capsize you, reducing your damage, or something. idk i could do a lot with this.
	fishing up mobs - either use fishing power as damage, or have them just also have damage, or maybe you have time to switch and you just do the command to fight it when you are ready, with a timelimit of like 5 minutes, or idk, have to talk abt it, this would be part of a great expansion update with lots of new items and such. this is a maybe im not really sure how i would do it, so might not happen.
	fighting - maybe have like up to 3 weapons and u can choose which one at the start each turn, always ephemeral to not clog and to not show, idk but a fighting update is needed obv, more weapons and stuff too

- near the end of summer, like august 10th or something, host a poll about how often people play rn (a significant amount every day, check in every day, check in most days, check in some days, rarely play, never play), and then do a similar poll underneath but for how often you predict you will play (be honest) when school starts back up. this will help me decide if i need to do a finale then (always got to end it on a strong note rather than a weak note, although the bot will still be up for ppl to play probably), or should keep it going till maybe christmas.

-----------------

- also an idea, hopefully i have a bit of traction on a channel for this (idk if its the nia channel or what), and then id like to turn this into a steam game. like $0.99 probably, and id probably have a free release on itch for those who cant afford it, but it wouldnt let them do multiplayer or achievements without steam. well you could do lan, but not online. id be looking for a partner to help code, mainly for the more technical parts, and ill focus on the content, but might not be needed. maybe someone for audio/sound i want it the sfx and music to be good. im thinking top down rpg style, and proper real time combat now. id do a waitlist and post sneak peaks, maybe devlogs, and stuff. this would be good, the wiki would be useful.

- id have to rename some items and mobs and stuff to be more original, or atleast just not a direct copy. like just do underworld not nether. call creepers something different. etc. id be able to revamp like all parts of the game. fighting would have like movement and stuff too, and also its real time not turn based. fishing and mining would be more visual since you can see stuff, also mobs might show up. like fishing might summon the kraken. i wanna do a whole like set of fishing mobs, from like jellyfish all the way up to cthulhu, and i guess all the super baits would be converted to mobs with special drops rather than just the special drop. mining would have stuff too but its more constant, like a mining skeleton is always the same difficulty, not like how you can get an easy jellyfish or one of the hardest mobs in the game. also it allows for more indirect abilities, rather just directly buffing stats and stuff. and dodging is a big part now. would be really cool. also for fighting its more like exploring, so you can see different structures and such. for plots that means you'd start with wilderness like exploring but you would be able to explore it and stuff, and you would build your own factories and stuff. it would be really cool. id probably have your land just be one area, and just if you want to explore in other areas to collect resources you can (you can't build but like you can still interact, so you can harvest crops, and you don't need to replant since its randomly generated, also you wouldn't be allowed that'd be considered placing), so your plot is just for building your own farms and machines and factories. and you would be building all of those yourself, rather than having like preset factories and machines.

- also i wanna have translation and stuff. so each like word or whatever would have some key, the way minecraft localisation works. it could also be like a number or whatever. so thered be an abstract class, and then child classes for number or for words. items would work similarly to minecraft, it would just substitute the items base name, like 'ironsword' which would be its in game item id, then for the proper version it would check the language for it. for number each language would have a field for like number format, and i would just manually code in how those work. at the start just roman numerals, and i would probably have to find people speaking the language that want to play the game so i can talk to them and make sure its working as intended.

- i would be able to have so much more stuff in game. i could have a lot more items and stuff. i also want to make it really easy to add new items and mobs and just content in general, i would probably make an in built modding thing, you just have to enable it in settings and then a new menu button would appear. i could also have item tiers, basic, special, mythical, legendary, godly, unique. i would work on this early on cause i imagine its how i would make a lot of my stuff. it would have an in built pixel drawer with the colors from the theme on the right, kinda like the very simple drawing programs, but there is only pen and erase (for transparency). also everything would have options for animations. idk im looking forward to it, so much i could do.

- this would be really cool as a fun singleplayer game, but also as a multiplayer game with friends. also combat would be way better, and also the map. like imagine being able to explore the ocean monument. idk about copyright i might have to change some stuff, a lot is just minecraft or terraria. anyways back to the modding, it would be super simple to play, you would attach mods to the server and everyone would automatically download them to play since its just simple json files. also an option for resource pack, and coding mods. i would probably call what i was previously calling mods something different, since its all automatic, maybe just like addons, and have them on steam marketplace. you can also make custom worlds with custom lore, that might be fun to play.
---------------

combat queue, items that i am thinking about adding but need an opening, either enough to add that it keeps a nice multiple (like 5 at a time) or a banned item in that category
-minibow, accessory, gives bow effect so allows you to shoot an arrow even if your holding a melee weapon, also would have to add some code to have tmp = count(Bow) + count(Rocket Launcher) + count(Star Launcher), and if tmp > 1: hits += tmp-1. that way the minibow will work even if you also have another bow, though if you have a rocket launcher neither will work since one won't have the ammo. fairly underpowered but i think its cool enough to add
-crossbow, weapon, not sure what makes it different from a regular bow, maybe a similar effect to sharp or something, and probably shoots bolts not arrows. so i guess its more 50:50 for piercing and blunt, and the sharp effect.
-lucky coin, accessory, already in but it could have some other effects relating to combat. critical chance, -10% acc, and just a general increase in drop items, like +20 power for those things.

temmie's pi crafting would only be available for temmie

for plots, there would be some items the player can't harvest on their own, like oil needs to be drilled, emerald and ores need to be mined, and also i think for pumpkins making a pumpkin farm (which would technically be a machine) using pumpkin seeds would be the only way to get pumpkins. it also needs to give u seeds somehow, and it cant be crafting that defeats the whole point if u could craft a bunch from bought pumpkins (even if limiting to the pumpkin seed flag u can do that later and break), maybe like 1/5 pumpkins turn into a pumpkin seed, and farms require 20 seeds, that way it requires killing or buying quite a few to even getting started, and also limits growth if each one only has like 50/day. i like that, it is a weird exception for that to be the only additional item, but if theres more i can code it to take from file. the pumpkin farm would have the advantage of only requiring pumpkin seeds, no machines or anything, as well as pumpkins being very very abundant in the jungle, and giving a lot of pumpkins, maybe like double what other plots would give. the melon equivalent would be like automatic melon farm, and crafted using only one melon, but plenty of machines, so very expensive.

pumpkin pie factory that makes them for slightly cheaper
various smelting/cooking factories, like for cooked cod/salmon and for glass, makes cheaper than any crafting if i do have a crafting

for duels have some banned items, these are permabanned for destroying the meta, some command to view these, starting out it will be all 3 netherite items, but flamethrower and rocket launcher might end up there, the reason they are banned not nerfed is that they make the meta stale, but still deserve to be good weapons for arena. however i think if i have weapon cycling it shouldnt matter, flamethrower just defeats any negative priority weapon cause its an insta kill already, let alone with a damage boost accessory, magic guard should help but still

for the rocket trio, crafting unlocks after a rocket is produced

commands for viewing all the info on items and mobs in different areas (try built into /mapinfo but that might be too much in one being 12 new fields) and info about mobs (/moblist + /mob <mob>).

mining differences summarised (for wiki): gold is 5x more common in nether, nether only has gold and orechunk nether has netherite bar overworld has 25-75 titanium bars, mineshaft have 2x iron, and despite its lore the mines have no extra resources

mobs
-warden, skeleton king, pumpkin horseman, elder guardian, ravager, giant, zoglin, and huge slime are all classified as mini-bosses. The skeleton horseman, piglin brute, and ghast are not mini-bosses despite being very rare, as they are found rare in some regions, as well as occuring in many regions. The piglin brute is very rare x2, rare, and uncommon; the ghast is very rare, and rare x4; and the skeleton horseman is very rare x8, and rare.
-pseudo mini boss status (on the wiki) for enemies strong enough to be a mini boss, but don't meet the rarity requirement of being solely very rare. in the lore there is only one of each mini boss and boss, so being commonly found in a place or found in multiple places disqualifies it from being a mini boss. this would be the skeleton horseman, piglin brute, and ghast.
-pseudo boss status (on the wiki) for enemies/mini bosses who's stats are more comparable with a boss than a mini boss. these would be the warden and skeleton king, who are strong even among mini bosses, and the warden even has its own unique effect just like the wither ("Deep Dark" and "Withering" respectively), although the wither's is way stronger, and the skeleton king even has its own unique trophy item just like the wither (crown and nether star respectively). though creepers technically have a unique explosion effect given its more of a drawback its not often considered. i will put the zoglin as a pseudoboss too but explain all tho it has the stats, and by a while, it is not as special or difficult so its status as a pseudoboss is debatable.
-pseudo mini boss and pseudo boss status would be like an additional tag, so the warden would be both a mini boss and a pseudo boss. pseudo boss is the higher ranking one though so thats the color it will take.
-also on the wiki, im imagining like each boss with its thing on the side like terraria, and i wanna include base stat totals not just stats, just a small thing but i think that would be useful for psuedo boss and pseudo mini boss having like a way to calculate it. sort of like pokemon's pseudo legendary but not like an exact amount. also have total damage, piercing health (health + defense*2), blunt health (health + defense), and effects, and a way to sort by damage in like the general enemy page. like a table, and also mention the effect in the last column. blank columns are represented with a dash, this is mainly for effects but also for blunt/piercing if one isn't used. also links everywhere in the wiki. there also will be something with location, maybe an ability to search only with ones in a specific location or something.
-wiki would have lots of groups to make it comparable, like weapon classes, recommended items for mini bosses etc. i also wanna mention the concept of walling (where piercing damage is completely nullified by defense). also the group of bulky minibosses, which are ravager, giant, and huge slime, which have at least 1000 hp, but not much going for them in terms of damage, so are easy to deal with high piercing damage set ups. the warden and wither also have at least 1000 hp, but they are a lot stronger.

effects
-lava fishing : allows fishing in lava
